# Computer-Science
 Created for my "Exploring Computer Science" class for Mr. Z. 
 Website can be found @ http://spencer.ga/sandbox/ and http://spencer.ga/throne/.
 First time using PHP for anything 'real', so it's not the cleanest or most advanced code there is.
 Experimented a bunch with CSS Animations (new to me) as well, and some jQuery stuff along with it.
